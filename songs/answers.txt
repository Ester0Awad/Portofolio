1- I can characterize the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018
by taking the average of energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs.

2- Taking the average of a person's energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs
and count how many that person played each song of his top 100 songs and measure the each song volume.
It probably seems that the most songs played and its volume was high than the other songs will characterize
the person's audio aura.
