#### Description: My personal website serves as a comprehensive representation of my skills, achievements, and dedication to personal and academic growth. By utilizing a combination of HTML and CSS, I have created a visually appealing platform that showcases my talents.Consisting of seven HTML pages, my website offers various sections and features that provide visitors with a comprehensive overview of who I am and what I have accomplished. At the heart of my website lies the home page, `index.html`, which acts as the central hub. This page offers a bio section where visitors can gain insights into my background and learn more about me. Additionally, I have included my contact information, including email and links to my social media profiles, to facilitate seamless communication. To enhance the aesthetics and overall appeal of my website, I have incorporated different CSS features. These include adjustments to font size, color, and weight, as well as the utilization of margin features to optimize the layout. I have also integrated social media icons obtained from Bootstrap and Font Awesome, allowing visitors to easily connect with me on various platforms. One of the key sections of my website is `education.html`, which delves into my educational background. Upon clicking on this page, visitors are presented with a detailed account of my academic journey, highlighting my qualifications and achievements. To ensure visual consistency and an appealing design, I have utilized margin features to harmonize the section with the rest of the website. Furthermore, I have included a hyperlink to 'Minerva University' that directs users to the university's website for additional information. Another significant section is `extracurricular.html`, where I showcase the various activities I participated in during high school. Each activity is accompanied by descriptive text, photos, and hyperlinks that lead users to relevant summer program websites. By skillfully utilizing margin features, font size adjustments, and precise photo dimensions in `styles.css`, I have ensured that this section seamlessly integrates into the overall design, providing an engaging user experience. Moreover, I have included small text descriptions beneath each photo to provide context and enhance the visitors' understanding. To demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning, I have dedicated a page titled `certificates.html` to showcase the certificates I earned from summer programs and online courses. This section serves as a testament to my dedication to personal and professional growth. Through the strategic use of width and height features, I have optimized the display of the certificates. Additionally, I have utilized the 'position' feature to ensure the certificates are appropriately placed on the website. For those interested in a more detailed overview of my qualifications, I have included a page titled `cv.html`. Here, visitors can access and download a PDF version of my curriculum vitae by clicking on the 'Open' link. To make this process effortless, I have hyperlinked the 'Open' text and utilized an icon obtained from Font Awesome. This feature enables HR representatives or potential employers to easily access and review my CV when considering me for a role. To streamline communication and facilitate connections, my `contact.html` page is dedicated to my social media presence. By incorporating Font Awesome and Bootstrap icons, I have provided links to all my social media profiles. Visitors can effortlessly connect with me on their preferred platform, fostering seamless communication. Lastly, my website's 'photos' section showcases captivating images that capture my active participation in various summer work and programs. These images serve as visual evidence of my commitment and enthusiasm. By incorporating these photos into the website, I strive to create a compelling narrative that resonates with visitors. To ensure visual consistency and enhance the overall appeal of my website, I have employed a separate CSS file named `styles.css`. This file contains a range of CSS features, including font styling, photo formatting, hyperlink customization, and margin adjustments. By thoughtfully implementing these features, I have created a cohesive design throughout the website. Additionally, I have capitalized on some of Bootstrap's margin features to optimize the layout of my HTML pages, further enhancing the user experience. All media elements, including photos in JPG and PNG formats, as well as the PDF file containing my CV, are conveniently stored in the project directory. This organization ensures easy accessibility for users, allowing them to explore and engage with the content seamlessly. In summary, my personal website, designed with HTML, CSS, and careful consideration, provides a comprehensive platform to showcase my skills, accomplishments, and personal growth. Through an aesthetically pleasing design and intuitive navigation, visitors can gain insights into my educational background, extracurricular activities, certificates, CV, and social media presence. The visual elements, along with the strategic use of CSS features, contribute to an engaging and informative user experience. As a result, my personal website effectively highlights my dedication, enthusiasm, and commitment to personal and academic development.
